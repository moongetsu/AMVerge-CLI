# AMVerge CLI

**AMVerge Features as a CLI Tool and Python Library.**  
Port of the AMVerge desktop app backend by [Crptk](https://github.com/crptk). Split videos into scenes, export clips, merge fragments, and build your own tools on top of it.

---

## Features

- **TransNetV2 ML detection** - deep learning scene boundary detection (GPU/CPU)
- **Keyframe detection** - fast I-frame based splitting, no re-encode
- **Edge detection** - Canny edges + cosine similarity for difficult encodes
- **Smart cut** - automatic lossless copy / smartcut / re-encode per scene
- **15 codec profiles** - H.264, HEVC, AV1, ProRes with hardware (NVENC) support
- **10 audio codecs** - AAC, FLAC, Opus, PCM, MP3, pass-through
- **3 container formats** - MP4, MKV, MOV (ProRes auto-enforces MOV)
- Auto-generated scene thumbnails (progressive JPEG)
- Duplicate / similar scene detection (cosine similarity)
- Scene export with full codec + audio + hardware selection
- Clip merging via FFmpeg concat
- Video metadata inspection and diagnostics
- TransNetV2 scene cache (.npy) - skip re-detection on re-open
- Discord Rich Presence (same app ID as AMVerge desktop)
- Interactive wizard mode (`amverge` with no args)
- Fully usable as a Python library - 52 names from `import amverge`

## How It Works

```txt
amverge CLI  /  Python library
          ↓
   amverge package
          ↓
    PyAV  +  FFmpeg  +  PyTorch (optional)
```

**Detection:** Keyframe mode extracts I-frame timestamps via PyAV packet demux.  
Edge mode decodes frames and compares Canny edge maps.  
TransNetV2 runs a deep CNN on 48x27 RGB frames (GPU auto-detected, CPU fallback).

**Cutting:** Scenes aligned to keyframes get lossless stream copy.  
Non-aligned scenes get smartcut (encode head + copy tail) or full re-encode.  
HEVC on CPU uses snapped-copy (nearest keyframe within 5s) to avoid slow re-encode.

**Thumbnails:** Decoded via PyAV, resized to 960px, saved as progressive JPEG in parallel.  
**Similarity:** Adjacent thumbnails compared via cosine similarity on 8x8 pooled pixels.

## Install

```bash
pip install amverge
```

See [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md) for FFmpeg setup, optional dependencies, and dev install.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Interactive wizard
amverge

# Direct commands
amverge detect episode.mp4
amverge export episode.mp4 --scenes episode_scenes/scenes.json --select 0,2,5-8
amverge merge clip1.mp4 clip2.mp4 --output out.mp4
amverge info episode.mp4
```

```python
from amverge import detect_scenes

result = detect_scenes("episode.mp4")
for scene in result.scenes:
    print(scene.index, scene.start, scene.end, scene.path)
```

## AI Agents

An [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) file is included for AI coding assistants (OpenCode, Claude Code, Cursor, etc.).

Using AI without understanding the codebase is not recommended. Read the code, understand the architecture, then use the agents file if it saves you time.

The best approach is not to use a generic AI assistant - it is to train it to work like you. Teach it your conventions, your decisions, your style. Done right, the output looks like yours, not like a generic answer. See [docs/ai-setup.md](docs/ai-setup.md) for a practical guide on how to do this.

## Credits

Built by [Moongetsu](https://github.com/Moongetsu) as a standalone port of the [AMVerge](https://github.com/crptk/AMVerge) backend.

AMVerge was created by [Crptk](https://github.com/crptk). All core scene detection and clip management logic originates from the original AMVerge project.
