# Examples

Runnable Python scripts showing how to use AMVerge as a library.
Each subdirectory covers one feature area with its own README.

---

## How to Run

Install AMVerge first:

```bash
pip install amverge[ml]        # TransNetV2 examples need [ml]
pip install amverge[ml,edge]   # all examples
```

Then run any script:

```bash
python examples/detect/01_basic_detect.py
```

Scripts expect a video file. Edit the `VIDEO` variable at the top of each file
or pass the video path as a command-line argument.
