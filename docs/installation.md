## FFmpeg

AMVerge CLI looks for `ffmpeg` / `ffprobe` in this order:

1. System PATH
2. A `bin/` folder in the current working directory

If neither is found, commands that require FFmpeg will fail with a clear error.

Download FFmpeg from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) or install via your package manager:

```bash
# Windows (winget)
winget install ffmpeg

# macOS
brew install ffmpeg

# Linux
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

---

## Verify Install

```bash
amverge doctor    # full health check - shows what is installed and working
amverge gpu       # PyTorch + CUDA + GPU info
amverge version   # all dependency versions
```

---

## Development Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moongetsu/AMVerge-CLI
cd AMVerge-CLI
pip install -e .
pip install -e ".[ml,edge,discord]"
```
